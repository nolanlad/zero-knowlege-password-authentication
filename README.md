# zero-knowlege-password-authentication
A nodejs library for a zero knowlege password authentication protocol using the discrete log problem

##Why zero knowlege proofs

Zero knowlege proofs are a way to prove the knowlege of information without revealing it to the party you are proving it to.

With zero knowlege password proofs allow users to not reveal their passwords over communication channels or to the the website itself giving the user more control over the security of their password

This library uses an interactive zero knowlege proof utilizing the discrete logarithm problem 

## This is a work in progress

Please be patient, there is a lot of work yet to do
